		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->

			 	<ul> 
                    <li>As per Vastushastra, the Main Door should be located at the East, North or North-East zone. If the door is located at the South or South-West zone then it is considered inauspicious.</li>
                    
                    <li>The main door should open inwards in a clockwise direction.</li>
                    
                    <li>Ensure that the picture / statue of Lord Ganesha ji does not back your house. Always ensure that the picture / statue of Lord Ganesha ji is installed back to back.</li>
                    
                    <li>Install a light outside the main door and keep it switched on especially during the evening hours.</li>
                    
                    <li>Swastik symbol depicts Lord Ganeshaji in symbolic form, hence do not install the symbol of Swastik & Maa Laxmiji Charan on the floor level.</li>
                        
                        <li>Presence of a tree or pole etc. in front of the shop / office / home  causes a ‘Dwaar Vedh’, which is inauspicious. It creates problems and disturbances in the business, such ‘Dwaar Vedh’ should be avoided.</li>
                        
                        <li>Ideally, we suggest to install our Vastu Product <a href="http://www.vastukripa.com/products-page/product-category/power-grid-stick-2/">‘Power Grid Stick’</a> above Door Frame.
