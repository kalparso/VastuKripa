		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->

                    <li>Vastushastra suggests to face Poorav disha (East zone) while studying i.e. the direction of the rising Sun. The Sun is a source of enlightenment and the ultimate source of power. Facing the Poorav disha (East zone) or Eshanya Kona (North-East) or Poorav Disha (East) will help you reset your mind, making you alert and help you absorb, understand and assimilate the text being read from the book. You would become more focused on the subject and would be able to grasp the topic. This will empower you to take correct decisions.</li>
                    
                    <li>In order to remain focused it is advisable to keep the study desk clean, clear and clutter free.</li>
