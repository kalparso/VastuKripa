		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->

                <li>The Tijori (Vault) / Drawer is opening towards the negative zones ie it should never open towards South or West direction because it could affect the flow of funds and create financial drains.</li>
                
                <li>The Tijori (Vault Locker) / Cash Drawer should open towards the Uttar disha (North zone) i.e the direction of Lord Kuber Devtaji, so that Lord Kuber Devtaji aspects the Locker at all times. As a second best alternative the Tijori (Vault Locker) / Cash Drawer should open towards the Poorav disha (East zone)</li>
                
                <li>The Tijori (Vault Locker), Cash Drawer, Cupboard which contains Cash, Valuables and Important Documents should be installed at the Nairuti kona (South-West zone).</li>

                <li> Do not keep shoes below the Tijori (Vault Locker) / Cash Drawer.</li>
                
                <li>The Tijori (Vault Locker) / Cash Drawer should be never be kept empty. It is always advisable to keep some valuables and cash permanently in it.</li>
                <li>Lord Kuber Devta ji is the Lord of Wealth and He is the presiding Lord of the Uttar disha (Northern direction). It is believed that when Lord Kuber Devta ji is pleased, He showers His blessings on the Devotee and this comes in the shape of growth in business, finances and wealth.</li>
