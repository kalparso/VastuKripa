		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->
