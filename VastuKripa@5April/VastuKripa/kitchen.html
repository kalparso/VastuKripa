		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->

                    <li>Ideally, the kitchen should be in the Agnisthaan (South-East zone) of the home. The second best position is the Vayu kona (North-West zone).</li>

                    <li>The gas burner stove should be placed in the Agni kona (South-East zone) of the kitchen and the person faces Poorav disha (East zone) while doing cooking.</li>
                    <li>The sink, water filter or pitcher (“matka” ) should be installed in the Uttar disha (North zone), Eshanya kona (North-East zone) or Poorav disha (East zone) of the kitchen.</li>
                    
                    <li>The heaters, conventional ovens, micro-waves ovens should be placed on the Agni kona (South-East zone) or Dakshin disha (South zone) of the kitchen.</li>

                    <li>Place heavy fridge, kitchen cabinets and other gadgets on the Dakshin disha (South zone) and Paschim disha (West zone).</li>
                    
                    <li>Maintain maximum distance between the gas burner and sink / water matka (i.e fire and water).</li>
                    
                    <li>Also ensure that you do not keep water bottles near the gas burner.</li>
                    
                    <li>Avoid black, grey shade granite kitchen platform / tiles. Prefer marble or maroon / brown granite. Prefer light subtle coloured tiles (off white, peach, light pink, cream, light yellow).</li>
                    
                    <li>Do not keep the broom (“jhadoo”) in a standing position.</li>
