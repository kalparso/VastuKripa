Lord Kuber Devta is the Lord of Wealth and He is the presiding Lord of the Uttar disha(Northern direction). It is believed that when Lord Kuber Devta is pleased, He showers His blessings on the Devotee and this comes in the shape of growth in business, finances and wealth. Lord Kuber Devta also opens up new avenues and opportunities leading to more sources of income. Lord Kuber Devta helps in removing the existing hindrances and speeds up the growth to 'Income' and 'Wealth'.</p>
                     <p class="para_style">• The cash drawer/vault(locker) should open towards the Uttar disha(North zone) ie. the direction of Lord Kuber Devtaji, so that Lord Kuber Devtaji aspects the locker at all times. As a second best alternative the cash drawer/vault (locker) should open towards the Poorav disha(East zone).</p>
                     <p class="para_style">• The 'Tijori'(Vault/Safe)/Cash Drawer should never open towards South or West direction because it could affect the flow of funds and create financial drains.</p>
                     <p class="para_style">• Paint the locker in yellow or off white shade(from inside and outside). Avoid grey, black and blue painted vault(locker).</p>
                     <p class="para_style">• General attributes of East zone(Poorav disha):<br>East Ruled by: Lord Soorya (The Sun God).<br>East Ruled by: Sun Planet(Sooya).<br>Color: Yellow/Golden/Orange.<br>Mantra to be recited: 'Om Hram Hrim Hroom Sah Suryaey Namah'.<br>Gemstone: Ruby (Manik).</p>
