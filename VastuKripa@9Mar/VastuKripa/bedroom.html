		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->
			<div class="inner_ultxt"  >
			 	<ul> 
                    <li>Master bedroom should be in the Nairuti Kona (South-West zone) of the house, in order to have better control, better co-ordination and enjoy a peaceful life.</li>
			 		<li>Son’s bedrooms room should be to the Paschim disha (West) or Dakshin disha (South).</li> 
			 		<li>Children and especially unmarried girls should not stay in the Nairuti kona (South-West zone) bedroom.</li>
                    <li> Ideally unmarried girls bedroom should allocated the Vayu Kona (North-West zone) bedroom.</li>
			 		<li>The guest room should be in the Vayu kona (North-West zone) and never in the Nairuti kona (South-West zone).</li>
                    <li>South-East direction is considered as ‘Agnisthaan” i.e. zone of fire. Persons sleeping in the South-East zone bedroom are prone to aggression, hyper temperament,irritation. Young couples and persons who are of angry nature should avoid sleeping in the South-East area bedroom.</li>
			 		<li>Place the bed in such a manner that your head is aligned towards the Dakshin disha (South) or the Poorav disha (East). Never sleep with your head towards the Uttar disha (North), else you may experience have sleepless nights and you may remain restless and uneasy.</li>
			 		<li>Do not install mirror opposite the bed. Also avoid mirror on West and South wall.</li>
                    <li> Either remove the mirror or cover it with paint / wall paper / curtain / fabric / roll down screen.</li>
