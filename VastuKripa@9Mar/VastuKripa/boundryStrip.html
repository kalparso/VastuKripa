		<p class="para_style">As per Vastushastra, it is suggested to have a rectangular shaped plot. Incase the Plot of Land is irregular shaped i.e. if any of the corners of the plot are extended or cut, it is suggested to create a ‘Physical Boundary Wall’ with bricks / stone (to separate/ cut off the extended corner of the plot). If it is not possible to create a ‘Physical ‘Vastu Boundary Wall’ then it is suggested to  create a ‘Virtual Vastu Boundary’ with the Vastu Boundary Energy Strips.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Embed the Vastu Boundary Energy Strip beneath the ground level of the plot. Placeit about 6 inches below the ground level.</li>
		<li>Install a Vastu Boundary Energy Strip after every 10 feet distance.</li>
		<li>Connect all the Vastu Boundary Energy Strip  with a Copper Patti or Copper Wire.</li>
		<li>At the Corners of the plot, install the Vastu Boundary Energy Strip at 90 degree sothat it forms an’ L’ shape</li>
