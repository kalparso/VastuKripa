                        <p class="para_style">• Not advisable to create the Director Cabin at North-East(Eshanya Kona), because this could affect the power and control of the Director. Ideally the Director cabins should be at the South-West, West or South zone.</p>
                        <p class="para_style">• Ensure that the Directors face North side(ideally) or North-East or East side, but the Director should not sit backing the door.</p>
                        <p class="para_style">• Avoid grey, black, blue upholstery, paint or laminates. Prefer brown, dull green, mustard shade upholstery.</p>
                        <p class="para_style">• In order to enhance the power and control of the Director, we suggest to Install our Vastu Product Accessories: <a href="http://www.vastukripa.com/products-page/GRID/">‘POWER GRID STICK’</a> on the wall(install it in the corresponding wall behind the Director's Seat at about 4 feet level or above.).</p>
