                     <p class="para_style">• Not advisable to create the Director Cabin at the South-East direction ie. in the 'Agnisthaan'(fire zone), because this could make the Director extremely furious, aggressive, volatile and hyper. Ideally the Director Cabins should be at the South-West, West or South zone. </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• The Creative Team(Designers) should occupy the South-East Cabin. </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• Ensure that the Directors face North side(ideally) or North-East or East side, but the Director should not sit backing the door. </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• Every-day, light a 'diya' or keep a bright red Color bulb switched on at the South-East corner of the cabin. </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• Avoid grey, black, blue upholstery, paint or laminates. Prefer brown, dull green, mustard shade upholstery. </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• In order to reduce the aggressiveness of the Director and to make him comfortable, we suggest to Install our Vastu Product Accessories: <a href="http://www.vastukripa.com/products-page/GRID/">‘POWER GRID STICK’</a>  on the wall(install it in the corresponding wall behind the Director Seat at about 4 feet level or above.).
                     <p class="para_style">• Also install the <a href="http://www.vastukripa.com/products-page/SACRED/">‘SACRED SYMBOL’</a> of Om or Swastik above the cabin entrance door frame(install it inside and outside). </p>
                     <p class="para_style">• General attributes of South-East zone(Agni Sthaan):<br>South-East Ruled by: Lord Agni(the God of Fire).<br>South-East Ruled by: Venus Planet(Shukra).<br>Color: Pink/White(Pinkish).<br>Mantra to be recited: 'Om Dram Drim Droom Sah Shukraey Namah'.<br>Gemstone: Diamond (Hira).<br>Element: Fire(Agni Tatva).</p>
