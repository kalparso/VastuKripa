		 	<!-- <p class="para_style"> Vastu Shastra is an ancient Hindu Vedic Science, which takes a holistic approach to design and create a layout of a factory, office and home which is in harmony with nature, the cosmic forces and the universe.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> Don\'t just look at your office, factory and home as just a structure of bricks, cement and ply-board. Your environment is throbbing with life. There is the solar energy, the movement of the planets, the magnetic fields of the earth, gravity, the influence of the five essential elements of nature (i.e water (jal), fire (agni), earth (prithvi), sky (akash), wind (vayu), geopathic stress, the global fields, the cosmic energy, the colours and pictures on the wall etc. all of which are all affecting your mind, body, life and business.</p>
			<p class="para_style"> All that we have and all that we do is governed by three factors</p> -->

                    <li>Never construct a Toilet in the Eshanya Kona (North-East zone), Agnisthaan (South-East zone), Nairuti Kona (South-West zone) or in the Brahmasthaan (center of the property). Also avoid constructing a Toilet at the Poorav Disha (East zone) and Uttar Disha (North zone).</li>
                    
                    <li>Never construct a toilet below a staircase.</li>

                    <li>Pictures / statues, sacred symbols or murals of God should not be installed on toilet common wall.</li>
                    
                    <li>The washbasin, shower and mirror should be installed on the Uttar disha (North side) or the Poorav disha (East side).</li>

                    <li> The toilet seat should be placed in such a manner that the person sitting on it faces Uttar disha (North side).</li>
                    <li>The person sitting on the WC pot should never face or back the rising Sun (Poorav disha – East side).</li>
                    
                    <li>Never install over-head water tank or under-ground water tank in the Agnisthaan (South-East zone).</li>
                    
                    <li>Prefer white, off white or beige shade tiles, WC pot and basin for all toilets.</li>
                    
                    <li>The toilet door should be kept closed even when not in use, to avoid negative energies to spread in the property.</li>
                    <li>If in your property the Toilet is constructed at the North-East, South-West, South-East, North or East and if it is not possible to relocate the Toilet to a more appropriate location, then we suggest to install our Vastu Product <a href="http://www.vastukripa.com/products-page/product-category/">‘Toilet Rectification Kit’</a>.(please refer to the kit manual for installation procedure).</li>
